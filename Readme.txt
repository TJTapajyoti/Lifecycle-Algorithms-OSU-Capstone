The SPA path analysis algorithm runs after input of data. The basic code that runs is a tree search algorithm to find the node with the highest value and 
then deduce the path of going to that node. The code that is used for running is runprog with a few inputs. The codes are like functions which run
to generate the results. 

Uncertainty.m is a short code snippet that is kind of dynamic ( a part of the code depends on the model being generated, hence needs to be changed. ) Used for 
model uncertainty calculations.
